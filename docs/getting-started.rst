Getting Started
===============

Installation
------------
.. code-block:: shell

   git clone https://github.com/seankmartin/SIMURAN
   cd SIMURAN
   pip install -e .

File structure
--------------

Mapping file
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Layout channels, wires, brain areas, etc. should be provided per animal (simuran_base_params).

Function file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Which functions to run on the data, what data and figures to save, and sort input files (simuran_fn_params).

Batch file
^^^^^^^^^^
Which files to select from a directory to run on, for example by using a REGEX pattern (simuran_batch_params).

Multi-batch file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Run a series of batch files, optionally merging the results afterwards, or running a final analysis on the compiled results (e.g.) clustering.

File list
^^^^^^^^^
Which files to run on, should be provided per animal.

Cell list
^^^^^^^^^
Which cells to analyse per file, should be provided per animal.

Directory layout
----------------

It is suggested that directories are layed out as:

.. code-block:: shell

   main_directory
      neural_data
      simuran
         analysis (custom analysis functions)
         parameters (simuran parameter files)
            file_lists
            cell_lists
         simuran_outputs

In this way, the layout files can be stored completely separately to the data,
but they can also be shared easily.

Examples
--------
Check out the examples in the examples folder of the main GitHub repository.
When these are a bit cleaner, I'll pop them up here also.
