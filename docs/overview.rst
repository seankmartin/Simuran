SIMURAN overview
================

Project purpose
---------------
SIMURAN is designed to help manage parameters and configuration files for large experiments in neuroscience. Particularly those involving analysing recordings performed in multiple brain regions simultaneously.

This website primarily serves to host the Python API documentation for SIMURAN.

Installation
------------
.. code-block:: shell

   git clone https://github.com/seankmartin/SIMURAN
   cd SIMURAN
   pip install -e .

Why the name?
-------------
SIMURAN stands for **Si**\ multaneous **Mu**\ lti-\ **R**\ egion **An**\ alysis. It is also a giant of the underworld in Philippine Mythology, which seems fitting given the difficulty of analysing large recordings.
