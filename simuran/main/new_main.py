# Pseudo of idea

# Step 1a (optional) - Help to set up table - maybe see table.py

# Step 2 - Read a filtered table, can explore with d-tale etc. before continuing (JASP)

# Step 3 - Iterate over the table performing a fixed function/s with some optional 
# parameters that change

# Step 4 - Save output of analysis in multiple formats
# CSV, straight to JASP etc.

# Step 5 - Support to view figures and tables from within the program

# Should support params in multiple formats of metadata

# IMPORTANT NEED TO BRANCH HERE.
